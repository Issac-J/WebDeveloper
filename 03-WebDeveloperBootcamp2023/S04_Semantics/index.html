    * A Semantic Element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
    * Example
        * Non-Semantic Elements: <div>, <span> 
        (These tell nothing about its content.)
        
        * Semantic Elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> ...
        (These Clearly define its content.)
    
    * Kind of Semantic Elements in HTML
        * <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, <details>, <footer>, ... etc.
    
    * Semantics's definitions allow HTML Processors, such as Web Browsers or Search engine, 
    to present and use documents and applications in a wide variety of contexts that the author might not have considered.

    * Comparing Examples : Medium Web Site VS Stripe
    Stripe 는 Semantics를 잘 활용한 예시 중 하나다.
