    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are marine molluscs of the order Sepiida. They
      belong to the class Cephalopoda which also includes squid, octopuses, and
      nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which
      is used for control of buoyancy. Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils,
      eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with
      which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25
      cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest species, the giant cuttlefish (Sepia
      apama), reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb)
      in mass.[3] Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus,
      worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators include dolphins, sharks,
      fish, seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical life expectancy
      of a cuttlefish is about 1-2 years. Studies are said to indicate
      cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent invertebrates.[4] Cuttlefish
      also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all
      invertebrates.[4] The "cuttle" in cuttlefish comes from the Old English
      name for the species, cudele, which may be cognate with the Old Norse
      koddi (cushion) and the Middle Low German Kudel (rag).[5] The Greco-Roman
      world valued the cuttlefish as a source of the unique brown pigment the
      creature releases from its siphon when it is alarmed. The word for it in
      both Greek and Latin, sepia, now refers to the reddish-brown color sepia
      in English.

    <h2>Fossil record</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The earliest fossils of cuttlefish are from the end of the Cretaceous
      period,[6][7] represented by Ceratisepia from the Late Maastrichtian
      Maastricht Formation of the Netherlands.[8] Although the Jurassic
      Trachyteuthis was historically considered possibly related to
      cuttlefish,[9] later studies considered to be more closely related to
      octopus and vampire squid.[10]
    </p>
    <h2>Range and habitat</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and
      temperate ocean waters. They are mostly shallow-water animals, although
      they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).[11] They have an
      unusual biogeographic pattern; they are present along the coasts of East
      and South Asia, Western Europe, and the Mediterranean, as well as all
      coasts of Africa and Australia, but are totally absent from the Americas.
      By the time the family evolved, ostensibly in the Old World, the North
      Atlantic possibly had become too cold and deep for these warm-water
      species to cross.[12] The common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), is found
      in the Mediterranean, North and Baltic seas, although populations may
      occur as far south as South Africa. They are found in sublittoral depths,
      between the low tide line and the edge of the continental shelf, to about
      180 m (600 ft).[13] The cuttlefish is listed under the Red List category
      of "least concern" by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This means
      that while some over-exploitation of the marine animal has occurred in
      some regions due to large-scale commercial fishing, their wide geographic
      range prevents them from being too threatened. Ocean acidification,
      however, caused largely by higher levels of carbon dioxide emitted into
      the atmosphere, is cited as a potential threat.[14]

    <h2>Anatomy and physiology</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Visual system</h3>
    <p>
      Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The
      organogenesis and the final structure of the cephalopod eye fundamentally
      differ from those of vertebrates such as humans.[15] Superficial
      similarities between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes are thought to be
      examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil is a smoothly
      curving W-shape.[16][17] Although cuttlefish cannot see color,[18] they
      can perceive the polarization of light, which enhances their perception of
      contrast. They have two spots of concentrated sensor cells on their
      retinas (known as foveae), one to look more forward, and one to look more
      backward. The eye changes focus by shifting the position of the entire
      lens with respect to the retina, instead of reshaping the lens as in
      mammals. Unlike the vertebrate eye, no blind spot exists, because the
      optic nerve is positioned behind the retina. They are capable of using
      stereopsis, enabling them to discern depth/distance because their brain
      calculates the input from both eyes.[19][20] The cuttlefish's eyes are
      thought to be fully developed before birth, and they start observing their
      surroundings while still in the egg. In consequence, they may prefer to
      hunt the prey they saw before hatching.[21]
    </p>
    <h3>Circulatory system</h3>
    <p>
      The blood of a cuttlefish is an unusual shade of green-blue, because it
      uses the copper-containing protein haemocyanin to carry oxygen instead of
      the red, iron-containing protein haemoglobin found in vertebrates' blood.
      The blood is pumped by three separate hearts: two branchial hearts pump
      blood to the cuttlefish's pair of gills (one heart for each), and the
      third pumps blood around the rest of the body. Cuttlefish blood must flow
      more rapidly than that of most other animals because haemocyanin carries
      substantially less oxygen than haemoglobin. Unlike most other mollusks,
      cephalopods like cuttlefish have a closed circulatory system.[22]
